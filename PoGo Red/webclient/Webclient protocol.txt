Client <-> Webclient Communications:


Player
----Inventory
--------Items
--------Pokemon
----Pokedex
----Location
----Path

Map
----Pokemon
----Pokestops
----Gyms


Webclient -> Sync info:
	This is necessary because, when the websocket is created, the onconnect event fires too quickly for the client
	Also, this will be good for when the player moves to a new location and has items that they're going to get rid of.
	This should cause the client to send a full barrage of information about the bot back to the webclient.
	{'sync': true}

Client -> Player Info:
    {'player': player_object}

Client -> Map Update:
    This should be fired every time the bot receives new information for pokestops, gyms, and/or pokemon.
	{"map": {'pokestops':[],
	         'gyms': [],
			 'pokemon': []}}

Client -> Location Change:
	{'location': {'latitude': lat, 'longitude': long}}

Client -> Inventory:
    {'inventory': {'items':[Item_object],
                   'pokemon':[Pokemon_object]}}
